    <h2>소개</h2>
    <p>
      I am a psychology major with a keen interest in emotion dysregulation in depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. I’m also interested in non-suicidal self-injury and the factors that contribute to its use as a coping strategy. My research aims to uncover why individuals resort to these behaviors and to identify tailored intervention methods that enhance adaptive emotion regulation. Ultimately, I hope to inform evidence-based treatments that reduce self-harm and suicide risk.
